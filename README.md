### Why The NextS tack

NextJs has made a lot of efforts to make React run better on the server but NextJs inherently doesn't come with any utility features for the backend for a good reason. It keeps the NextJs focused on improving the underlying framework itself and allows the team behind it to release cutting edge features more frequently. This is where Next Stack comes in, this stack is all about making NextJs a robust backend framework with abstractions and utility features. This stack is heavily inspired by the [Create T3 App](https://create.t3.gg).
